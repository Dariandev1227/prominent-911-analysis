# Prominent Edge Test Assessment

I spent 4 hours working on this project.

### Things I would have done if it was production

1. I will write some test cases and improve UI with responsiveness.

###

## Available Scripts

### `Add ENV`

create `.env.local` file in the src folder and add following keys and url.
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN = ""
REACT_APP_WEATHER_URL = "https://meteostat.p.rapidapi.com/point/hourly"
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY = ""

### `npm install`

Run the command to install dependencies for the app

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
